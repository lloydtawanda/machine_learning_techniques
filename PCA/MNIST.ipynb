    "PCA is effected by scale so you need to scale the features in the data before applying PCA. You can transform the data onto unit scale (mean = 0 and variance = 1) which is a requirement for the optimal performance of many machine learning algorithms. StandardScaler helps standardize the dataset’s features. Note you fit on the training set and transform on the training and test set. If you want to see the negative effect not scaling your data can have, scikit-learn has a section on the [effects of not standardizing your data](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/preprocessing/plot_scaling_importance.html#sphx-glr-auto-examples-preprocessing-plot-scaling-importance-py)."
